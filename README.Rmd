**Consensys** is an interactive R Shiny application for exploring, visualizing, and simulating group decision-making and judgment processes. Based on foundational theories in group psychology—**Social Decision Scheme (SDS)** and **Social Judgment Scheme (SJS)**—the app helps users intuitively understand how individual inputs combine into collective outcomes.

## 🚀 Try the App

The app is deployed and accessible at:

🔗 [Consensys on Posit Cloud](https://jrwinget-consensys.share.connect.posit.cloud)

---

## Features

- **Social Decision Scheme (SDS) Modeling**
  - Visualize and experiment with classic decision rules (e.g., majority, unanimity, proportionality).
  - Customize decision matrices and explore outcome probabilities interactively.

- **Social Judgment Scheme (SJS) Simulations**
  - Model continuous judgments using similarity-based weights and confidence levels.
  - Conduct sensitivity analyses on weighting schemes and group consensus thresholds.

- **Dynamic Simulation Engine**
  - Simulate group decision processes across rounds with real-time plots.
  - Customize group size, initial positions, and aggregation parameters.

---

## Getting Started (Locally)

Explore how groups make decisions through interactive simulations.

![Consensys Landing Page](man/figures/app-landing.png)

After launching the app:

- Begin with the **Quick Start Guide** on the landing page
- Learn about SDS and SJS under the collapsible info sections
- Choose a simulation from the top navigation:  
  - **Social Decision Scheme** to explore rule-based aggregation  
  - **Social Judgment Scheme** to simulate confidence-weighted consensus  
- Use the "Try it" buttons to dive into either model
- Visual feedback is instant—great for teaching or insight-building

Learning time is under 10 minutes!
